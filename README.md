# Fault-Diagnosis-of-Combinational-Circuits
Digital systems, even when designed with highly reliable components, do not operate for ever without developing some faults, When a system ultimately does develop a fault it has to be detected and located so that its effect can be removed. 
Fault detection means the discovery of something wrong in a digital system or circuit 
Fault location means the identification of the faults with components, functional modules or subsystems, depending on the requirements 
 Fault diagnosis includes both fault detection and fault location
Fault diagnosis in combinational circuits is crucial for maintaining system reliability.
Combinational circuits perform key logic functions in digital systems.
Fault Diagnosis ensures reliable circuit operation and prevents system failures.
Therefore, Fault diagnosis is vital for preserving correct circuit behavior and ensuring system reliability.
